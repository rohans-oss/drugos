"""FIX-B (Neo4j Node Property Strip) -- patient-safety regression test.

This test file is the FORENSIC proof that the production Neo4j load path
(``run_pipeline.step3_load_neo4j``) preserves patient-safety properties
(``withdrawn``, ``fda_approved``, ``clinical_status``, ``molecular_weight``,
``inchikey``, ``smiles``, ...) on Compound nodes when the data source is
Phase 1 (the bridge path).

THE BUG THIS TEST LOCKS DOWN
----------------------------
Before FIX-B, ``step3_load_neo4j`` reconstructed each node as a bare
``{"id": eid, "entity_type": etype}`` dict:

    entity_type_data[etype] = [
        {"id": eid, "entity_type": etype}
        for eid in id_map.keys()
    ]
    node_results = builder.load_drkg_nodes(entity_type_data)

The bridge (``phase1_bridge.RecordingGraphBuilder``) had already populated
the full property dicts (``withdrawn``, ``fda_approved``,
``clinical_status``, ``molecular_weight``, ``inchikey``, ``smiles``,
etc.) on Compound nodes -- and the in-memory test path preserved them --
but the production Neo4j load path STRIPPED them. Cerivastatin
(withdrawn 2001 for rhabdomyolysis) would have its ``withdrawn=True``
flag LOST in production Neo4j. The RL safety ranker would then treat
it as SAFE. Patient-safety risk.

THE FIX
-------
``step1_load_phase1`` now exposes a ``node_props_lookup`` dict keyed by
``(label, node_id)`` -> full property dict. ``step3_load_neo4j`` reads
this lookup (when provided) to build the per-type node lists. The
production ``kg_builder.load_nodes_batch`` then applies
``NODE_PROPERTY_WHITELIST`` + ``SYSTEM_PROPS`` itself -- keeping the
whitelist as the single source of truth for schema enforcement.

THE TEST
--------
1. Run the bridge to populate a ``RecordingGraphBuilder`` with the toy
   fixture shipped in ``phase1/processed_data/``.
2. Build ``entity_maps``, ``edge_maps`` and ``node_props_lookup`` (either
   via ``step1_load_phase1`` or directly from the recorder).
3. Call ``step3_load_neo4j(..., skip_neo4j=True, dry_run_capture=capture)``
   so we can inspect the exact node dicts that WOULD have been sent to
   Neo4j -- without contacting Neo4j.
4. Assert that every Compound node in the captured ``entity_type_data``
   retains ``withdrawn``, ``fda_approved``, ``clinical_status``,
   ``molecular_weight``, ``inchikey``, ``smiles``.
5. Assert that the DRKG path (``node_props_lookup=None``) still produces
   the legacy bare-dict shape (so the fix is backward-compatible).
6. Assert that the production whitelist (``NODE_PROPERTY_WHITELIST``)
   would NOT strip the patient-safety properties (the whitelist
   explicitly allows them -- bug #B5 fix).
