"""Tests for FIX-D (ML Training Correctness) -- issues C-14, C-12, C-13, C-21.

These tests verify the four ML-training-correctness fixes applied in v26:

  * C-14 -- ``kg_builder --dedup`` CLI was a stub. ``total_removed`` was
    always 0 because the branch only logged "need full triple (src, rel,
    dst)" for each edge type. The fix wires the CLI to actually call
    ``DrugOSGraphBuilder.deduplicate_edges_deterministic`` for each
    (src, rel, dst) triple derived from ``CORE_EDGE_TYPES``.

  * C-12 -- Train/val/test split in ``step11_train_transe`` was fully
    random over mixed-relation triples, and ``temporal_split_pairs``
    (training_data.py) was dead code. The fix attempts a temporal split
    via ``temporal_split_pairs`` when approval-year data is available,
    and otherwise falls back to a stratified-by-relation-type random
    split (each relation contributes proportional 80/10/10).

  * C-13 -- ``chemberta_encoder.py`` (1925 lines) is real but was never
    invoked from ``run_pipeline.py``. ``step9_build_pyg`` always fell
    back to random Xavier features. The fix wires ``step9_build_pyg`` to
    optionally compute ChEMBERTa SMILES embeddings (opt-in via
    ``DRUGOS_USE_CHEMBERTA=1`` + ``HF_TOKEN`` + ``transformers``) and
    attach them via ``PyGBuilder.add_chemberta_features``.

  * C-21 -- ``pyg_builder.build_from_drkg`` wrote every (src, dst) pair
    from ``edge_maps`` to ``edge_index`` without deduplication. The fix
    adds a (src, dst) deduplication pass per edge type.
