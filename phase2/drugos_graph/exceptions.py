"""DrugOS Graph Module -- Exception Hierarchy
============================================
Domain-specific exceptions for the DrugOS data pipeline.

This module centralises the exception types raised by the data loaders
(notably ``uniprot_loader``) so that callers can catch failures with the
appropriate granularity. Every exception here carries enough context
(URL, accession, line number, remediation hint) to debug a 3 AM pipeline
failure without re-reading the source file.

Design rules (audit issues D6-006, D1-002):
  * Exceptions are **additive** -- they do not replace any stdlib exception.
    Existing ``except FileNotFoundError`` / ``except Exception`` blocks in
    callers continue to work because these new types subclass the most
    relevant stdlib base.
  * Every exception stores a structured ``context`` dict so that the
    dead-letter writer and the structured logger can serialise it without
    re-formatting strings.
  * No third-party dependencies -- stdlib only.

v108 ROOT FIX (issue 77): the historical base class is ``DrugOSDataError``.
External audits and Phase 3 callers refer to it as ``DrugosGraphError``.
We now expose ``DrugosGraphError`` as a TRUE subclass (not a bare alias) so
that ``except DrugosGraphError`` catches every exception in this module
while ``except DrugOSDataError`` continues to work for legacy callers.
Both names refer to the same hierarchy root and remain interchangeable
for catch purposes. New code should use ``DrugosGraphError``.

Fixes: D6-006 (wrap raw URLError), D1-002 (Loader Protocol error contract),
       D5-005/D5-007 (data-integrity guard errors).

# =============================================================================
# GEO exceptions -- added by geo_loader v1.0.0 institutional-grade audit fix
# (GEO_LOADER_MASTER_REPAIR_PROMPT.md -- 192 findings across 16 domains).
#
# These eight exception types extend the DrugOSDataError hierarchy with
# GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)-specific failures. They follow the same
# ``context`` kwarg pattern as every other loader exception so the dead-
# letter writer and the structured logger can serialise them without
# re-formatting strings.
#
# IMPORTANT catch-granularity design (mirrors ClinicalTrials/OpenTargets/
# SIDER/STITCH/STRING siblings):
#   * GEO exceptions are SIBLINGS of the other loader exceptions -- they
#     do NOT subclass any sibling. This means
#     ``except ClinicalTrialsDownloadError`` will NOT catch
#     ``GeoDownloadError``. Callers wanting to catch any loader failure
#     should use ``except DrugOSDataError``.
#   * ``GeoParseError`` MULTIPLE-INHERITS from ``DrugOSDataError`` AND
#     ``FileNotFoundError`` so existing ``except FileNotFoundError``
#     blocks in callers continue to work (backward compat -- Rule R4).
#
# Patient-safety doctrine: GEO is the SOLE source of
# Protein->expressed_in->Anatomy edges in the KG. If this loader silently
# produces zero records, the KG lacks the entire tissue-specificity
# modality, the Graph Transformer cannot learn that a drug target is
# absent from the disease tissue, and a clinician can be handed a
# "high-confidence" repurposing candidate that will fail in Phase II --
# or harm a patient in a clinical-trial setting. These exceptions MUST
# NOT be silenced -- every ``except GeoCriticalError`` block must either
# re-raise or fail the pipeline loudly (master prompt Rule R5).
