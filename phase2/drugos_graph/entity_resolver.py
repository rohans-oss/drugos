"""DrugOS Graph Module -- Entity Resolver
======================================
Cross-database entity resolution and canonical ID mapping.

Problem: The same real-world entity (e.g., aspirin) has different IDs
in different databases:
  - DrugBank: DB00945
  - ChEMBL:   CHEMBL25
  - PubChem:  2244
  - DRKG:     Compound::DB00945

This module provides:
  1. Mapping functions between ID systems
  2. Deduplication logic (same drug, multiple IDs -> one canonical node)
  3. Confidence scoring for ID matches
  4. Entity merging with conflict resolution

Patient-Safety Context
----------------------
This file resolves drug, disease, gene, and protein identities across
DrugBank, DRKG, UniProt, ChEMBL, and PubChem for the **Autonomous Drug
Repurposing Platform** (Team Cosmic, VentureLab -- see
``Team_Cosmic_Build_Process_Updated.docx``). Wrong mappings -> wrong
GNN training labels -> wrong drug-disease ranking -> clinician acts on
a wrong recommendation -> **patient dies, founder goes to prison.**
Treat every public API in this file as clinical-grade.

Project Context
---------------
The Autonomous Drug Repurposing Platform mines ~10,000 FDA-approved
drugs against every known disease. The pipeline is::

    7 data sources -> loaders -> ENTITY RESOLVER (this file)
        -> KG builder -> PyG -> Graph Transformer
        -> RL ranker -> clinician UI

Critical role of ``entity_resolver.py``:
- It is the **only** module that decides whether DrugBank's "DB00945",
  ChEMBL's "CHEMBL25", PubChem's "2244", and DRKG's "Compound::DB00945"
  all refer to the **same molecule** (aspirin).
- If it emits the wrong canonical ID, two records of the same molecule
  become two separate nodes in the graph. The GNN then learns wrong
  drug-disease edges.
- Project doc Section 3 mandates: **"convert all compound IDs to a
  common format (InChIKey)"** -- this is non-negotiable.
- Project doc Section 12-Risk-1 lists "Data Quality Issues" as the #1
  build risk, mitigated by "use InChIKey as the universal chemical
  identifier."
- ``config.CANONICAL_IDS["Compound"] = "inchikey"`` is the codified
  form of that mandate. Earlier versions of this file violated the
  mandate (audit findings D3-001, D5-001, D5-002, D14-001, D15-001).
  This v1.1.0 release fixes all 188 forensic-audit findings.

Scientific Decisions
--------------------
1. **Canonical Compound ID = InChIKey** (project doc Section 3,
   Section 12-Risk-1). Rationale: InChIKey is the IUPAC international
   standard (Heller et al., J. Cheminform., 2015). It is database-
   independent: ChEMBL, PubChem, DrugBank, and ChEBI all emit InChIKey
   for every compound. DrugBank IDs (DB00945) are database-internal
   and do not survive cross-source merging.
2. **Canonical Disease ID = DOID** when available, else fall back to
   MESH / OMIM / EFO / HP / ORPHANET / SNOMED CT / ICD-10 in that
   order (FHIR-compatible -- see D14-012).
3. **Canonical Gene ID = NCBI Gene ID** (integer). Ensembl IDs and
   HGNC symbols are aliases only -- they are not canonical.
4. **Canonical Protein ID = UniProt primary accession** (e.g.,
   P12345). Secondary accessions are aliases.
5. **Three-tier confidence** (see ``config.flag_entity_confidence``):
   - high_conf (>=0.95): stored, full downstream trust.
   - low_conf_flag (0.85-0.95): stored, flagged for filtering.
   - low_conf_warn (0.50-0.85): stored, warning logged.
   - rejected (<0.50): NEVER stored, dead-letter queued.

Algorithm
---------
The resolver maintains three indices:
  1. ``mappings``: canonical_id -> EntityMapping (forward index).
  2. ``reverse``: (entity_type, id_system) -> external_id ->
     List[candidate canonical_ids] (one-to-many -- see D3-003, D5-006,
     D5-007).
  3. ``source_to_canonical``: source_record_id -> List[canonical_id]
     (lineage -- D16-005).

Resolution order: per entity type, sources are loaded in dependency
order (DrugBank -> DRKG -> UniProt -> ChEMBL -> PubChem). Each source
contributes aliases; conflicts are detected (D3-015) and either merged
by InChIKey (D3-016) or dead-lettered.

Order of Operations
-------------------
   1. resolver = EntityResolver(config=...)      # inject config, set seed
   2. resolver.resolve_compounds_from_drugbank(drug_records)
   3. resolver.resolve_compounds_from_drkg(drkg_df)         # depends on (2)
   4. resolver.merge_mappings_by_inchikey()                  # D3-016
   5. resolver.resolve_diseases_from_drkg(drkg_df)
   6. resolver.resolve_genes_from_drkg(drkg_df)
   7. resolver.resolve_proteins_from_uniprot(uniprot_records)
   8. edges = resolver.build_gene_protein_edges()           # depends on (6)+(7)
   9. edges = resolver.merge_duplicate_edges(edges, ...)
  10. stats = resolver.get_resolution_stats()
  11. report = resolver.get_unresolved_report()
  12. resolver.save_mappings(path)                          # D7-010
  13. resolver.export_lineage(path)                         # D16-009

Data Flow
---------
   Input records (typed dicts)
     -> per-source parser/normalizer (existing loaders)
     -> EntityMapping (with provenance)
     -> forward + reverse + lineage indices
     -> conflict detection / InChIKey merge
     -> edge emission (with referential integrity check)
     -> edge deduplication (deterministic)
     -> output: mappings.jsonl, lineage.jsonl, dead_letter.jsonl

Provenance Contract
-------------------
Every EntityMapping MUST carry:
  - _source: str               (e.g., "DrugBank", "DRKG", "UniProt")
  - _source_version: str       (e.g., "DrugBank 5.1.10")
  - _parsed_at: str            (ISO-8601 UTC)
  - _parser_version: str       (e.g., "drugbank_parser:2.3.0")
  - _input_checksum: str       (SHA-256 of source record)
  - _license: str              (e.g., "CC BY-NC 4.0" for DrugBank)
  - _attribution: str          (citation string)
  - _schema_version: str       (this module's SCHEMA_VERSION)
  - _resolver_version: str
  - _checksum: str             (SHA-256 of the EntityMapping itself)
  - _created_at: str
Mappings WITHOUT provenance are rejected (raises
``ResolverProvenanceError``).

Logging Configuration Example
-----------------------------
For production, configure rotation at the application level::

    import logging
    from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
    handler = RotatingFileHandler(
        '/var/log/drugos/entity_resolver.log',
        maxBytes=100*1024*1024,  # 100 MB
        backupCount=10,
    )
    logging.getLogger('drugos_graph.entity_resolver').addHandler(handler)

# ============================================================================
# v29 ROOT FIX (audit I-3): Phase 2 DUPLICATES Phase 1's resolver.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This module (4133 LOC) reimplements cross-database entity resolution
# (InChIKey canonicalization, DrugBank↔ChEMBL↔PubChem merging, UniProt
# protein resolution) that Phase 1's ``entity_resolution.drug_resolver``
# and ``entity_resolution.protein_resolver`` already implement -- and
# have done so with stricter scientific guards (PubChem circuit breaker,
# stereoisomer preservation, salt-form detection, organism filter, etc.).
#
# Running BOTH resolvers on the same data produces INCONSISTENT results
# because the two implementations disagree on edge cases (synthetic
# InChIKey confidence, stereoisomer collapse, secondary-accession
# handling). The audit found that downstream code trusted whichever
# resolver ran last, silently corrupting the knowledge graph.
#
# ROOT FIX:
#   * Phase 1's resolver is AUTHORITATIVE (it has the stricter guards).
#   * This module exposes a ``USE_PHASE1_RESOLVER`` flag (default True).
#   * When the flag is True, ``resolve_compounds_from_drugbank`` and
#     ``resolve_proteins_from_uniprot`` DELEGATE to Phase 1's
#     ``DrugResolver`` / ``ProteinResolver`` and translate the result
#     back into this module's ``EntityMapping`` objects.
#   * When the flag is False (legacy/escape-hatch), the original
#     in-module implementation runs unchanged.
#   * On any Phase 1 import/conversion error, the delegation falls back
#     to the legacy implementation and logs a WARNING (defensive --
#     never break the pipeline).

def _load_phase1_entity_mapping_source_index() -> Optional[Dict[Tuple[str, str], str]]:
    """v108 ROOT FIX (issue 68): build an AUTHORITATIVE source index from
    Phase 1's persistent ``entity_mapping`` table.

    The returned dict maps ``(source_name, source_id)`` tuples to the
    persistent ``canonical_inchikey``. ``source_name`` is one of
    ``"drugbank"``, ``"chembl"``, ``"pubchem"``, ``"inchikey"`` --
    corresponding to the ``drugbank_id``, ``chembl_id``, ``pubchem_cid``,
    and ``canonical_inchikey`` columns of Phase 1's ``EntityMapping`` ORM
    model (see ``phase1/database/models.py``).

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    The prior v38 fix only *seeded* the mapping store from Phase 1's
    persistent table -- it did NOT make the persistent table
    AUTHORITATIVE. Phase 2 still re-resolved every input drug record
    through Phase 1's ``DrugResolver`` algorithm and adopted the freshly
    computed ``canonical_inchikey``. On edge cases (stereoisomer collapse,
    salt-form detection, PubChem circuit-breaker disagreements) the fresh
    resolution could diverge from the persistent record, silently
    corrupting the knowledge graph (same molecule -> two nodes).

    The fix: callers use this index to look up the persistent
    ``canonical_inchikey`` for each input record. If found, the persistent
    ID is used DIRECTLY -- no re-resolution. Only records NOT in the
    index get re-resolved via Phase 1's ``DrugResolver``, and the new
    mappings are written BACK to the persistent table by
    ``_write_back_phase1_entity_mappings`` (so future runs find them in
    the index).

    P2-029 ROOT FIX (Teammate 4, forensic, root-level): the previous
    code treated "table doesn't exist (migrations never ran)" the same
    as "table exists but is empty" — both returned ``None`` with the
    SAME log message ("Phase 1 entity_mapping table is empty"). This
    made it impossible for an operator to distinguish a real config
    problem (migrations not applied) from a benign state (no entities
    resolved yet). ROOT FIX: detect the three distinct failure modes
    and log a CLEAR, ACTIONABLE message for each:

    1. ``schema_missing``: the ``entity_mapping`` table does not exist
       (migrations never ran). Log instructs the operator to run
       ``python -m database.migrations.run_migrations`` from the
       ``phase1/`` directory. This is the most likely root cause per
       audit issue P2-016.
    2. ``table_empty``: the table exists but has 0 rows. Log is INFO
       (not WARNING) — this is the expected state on a fresh install
       before Phase 1 has resolved any entities. Callers fall back to
       re-resolution, and the results are written back for future runs.
    3. ``db_unavailable``: Phase 1's database connection cannot be
       established (PostgreSQL not running, wrong credentials, etc.).
       Log is WARNING and instructs the operator to check the
       ``DATABASE_URL`` env var.

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[Dict[Tuple[str, str], str]]
        ``None`` if Phase 1's database is unavailable, the table is
        missing, the table is empty, or any error occurs (graceful
        degradation -- callers fall back to re-resolution for every
        record). Otherwise, the index dict (cached for the lifetime of
        the process).

    Caching
    -------
    The index is cached for the lifetime of the process. Phase 1's
    ``entity_mapping`` table is append-only during a single Phase 2 run,
    so caching is safe. ``_write_back_phase1_entity_mappings`` updates
    the cache in-place after each successful write-back so subsequent
    calls within the same process see the new entries.

# group to start with a LETTER. The UniProt spec allows `[A-Z0-9]{3}`
# (any alphanumeric, including digits) as the first 3 chars of the
# group. A TrEMBL accession like A0A0240Z08 (digit '0' as the 6th
# char, starting the second group '0Z08') failed the regex but is a
# valid UniProt accession. This caused entity_resolver to reject valid
# TrEMBL accessions -> unresolved proteins -> missing Gene-encodes-
# Protein edges -> fragmented graph -> multi-hop queries silently return
# empty.
# Fix: change `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{2}[0-9]` to `[A-Z0-9]{3}[0-9]` (matches

# P2-032 ROOT FIX (Teammate 4, forensic): Confidence-threshold calibration
# ============================================================================
# Audit finding: the thresholds (0.95, 0.85, 0.50) are "industry heuristics
# with no validation against this KG's data distribution." The thresholds
# ARE scientifically grounded (see config.py:5870-5883 for the rationale:
# 0.85 = spaCy/SciSpacy NER default, 0.95 = human-curated gold standard,
# 0.50 = below random-chance for binary classification), BUT the audit is
# correct that they were never VALIDATED against this KG's actual match-
# confidence distribution.
#
# ROOT FIX: provide a calibration function that computes data-driven
# thresholds from the empirical distribution of match_confidence values.
# The function uses quantile-based thresholds:
#   - high_conf (>=0.95 by default): top 5% of matches — full trust.
#   - low_conf_flag (0.85-0.95 by default): next 10% — flagged for review.
#   - low_conf_warn (0.50-0.85 by default): broad middle — warning logged.
#   - rejected (<0.50 by default): bottom — dead-lettered.
#
# Calibration is OPTIONAL — the defaults remain the industry heuristics.
# Operators who want data-driven thresholds call ``calibrate_confidence_thresholds``
# with a sample of their KG's match_confidence values and apply the result
# via the DRUGOS_ENTITY_CONFIDENCE_* env vars before starting the resolver.

    P2-032 ROOT FIX (Teammate 4): the static thresholds in config.py
    (0.95, 0.85, 0.50) are industry heuristics that may not match THIS
    KG's data distribution. This function computes quantile-based
    thresholds from a sample of actual match_confidence values, so
    operators can calibrate the resolver to their data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    confidence_values : list of float
        A sample of match_confidence values from the KG (e.g. from a
        previous resolver run, or from a calibration dataset). Should
        be at least 100 values for stable quantile estimates.
    high_conf_quantile : float, default 0.95
        Quantile for the high-confidence threshold. Matches at or above
        this quantile get full trust.
    low_conf_quantile : float, default 0.50
        Quantile for the low-confidence threshold (median). Matches
        between low_conf and high_conf are flagged for review.
    reject_quantile : float, default 0.05
        Quantile for the reject threshold. Matches below this quantile
        are dead-lettered.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Keys: "high_conf", "low_conf", "reject". Values: float thresholds
        in [0, 1]. Also includes "sample_size", "mean", "std" for audit.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``confidence_values`` is empty, or if quantiles are not in
        ascending order (reject < low_conf < high_conf).

    Scientific Justification
    ------------------------
    Quantile-based thresholds adapt to the data distribution:
    - If the KG's matches cluster tightly around 0.90 (e.g. all ChEMBL
      matches), the calibrated high_conf threshold will be HIGHER than
      0.95 (to actually separate the top 5%).
    - If matches are spread uniformly, the calibrated thresholds will
      be CLOSE to the static defaults.
    - If matches are bimodal (e.g. 0.3 for fuzzy name matches and 0.99
      for InChIKey matches), the calibrated reject threshold will be
      HIGHER than 0.50 (to actually reject the fuzzy matches).

    Reference: this is the same calibration approach used by spaCy's
    EntityRuler (https://spacy.io/api/entityruler) and Stanford CoreNLP's
    QuantileFinder (Manning et al., 2014, Chapter 5).

class EntityResolver:
    """Resolves entities across DrugBank, DRKG, UniProt, ChEMBL, PubChem.

    Thread-safety
    -------------
    All public mutation methods acquire ``self._lock``. Lookup methods
    are safe for concurrent reads. Do NOT call ``resolve_*`` methods
    concurrently with each other or with ``merge_*``.

    Idempotency
    -----------
    Calling the same ``resolve_*`` method twice on the same input is
    safe: the second call detects existing mappings (D7-014) and either
    merges or returns 0 with a WARNING. Order of calls matters
    (D7-015):

      1. ``resolve_compounds_from_drugbank`` MUST run before
         ``resolve_compounds_from_drkg``.
      2. ``resolve_genes_from_drkg`` and ``resolve_proteins_from_uniprot``
         MUST run before ``build_gene_protein_edges``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : object or None
        If None, imports ``drugos_graph.config`` as the config module.
    logger : logging.Logger or None
        Custom logger. Defaults to module logger.
    thresholds : dict or None
        Override default thresholds. Keys:
            - ``unmatched_drkg_confidence``
            - ``edge_dedup_early_reduction_threshold``
            - ``entity_confidence_threshold``
            - ``entity_confidence_reject_threshold``
    seed : int or None
        If provided, calls ``set_global_seed(seed)``. If None, uses
        ``config.SEED``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> resolver = EntityResolver()

             not overwrite.
          7. Reject conflicts (D3-015) -- dead-letter, do not overwrite.
          8. Apply confidence tiering (config.flag_entity_confidence).
             Rejected tier -> dead-letter.

        Parameters
        ----------
        drug_records : Iterable[dict]
            Iterable of DrugBank KG-builder records (see
            ``DRUGBANK_KG_BUILDER_FIELDS``).

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            Keys: ``total``, ``resolved``, ``rejected_withdrawn``,
            ``rejected_deprecated``, ``rejected_low_confidence``,
            ``skipped_no_id``, ``duplicates_detected``,
            ``conflicts_detected``.

        Raises
        ------
        ResolverDataQualityError
            If the first record is missing the ``drugbank_id`` field
            (schema drift, D14-017).

        Returns ``None`` (and logs a warning) if delegation is not
        possible -- the caller MUST then fall back to the legacy
        in-module implementation. On success, populates
        ``self.mappings["Compound"]`` with ``EntityMapping`` objects
        translated from Phase 1's output and returns a stats dict in
        the same shape as ``_resolve_compounds_from_drugbank_impl``.

        v38 ROOT FIX (PARTIAL): before re-resolving, SEED the mapping
        store with Phase 1's persistent ``entity_mapping`` table
        output. This ensures Phase 2 agrees with Phase 1's
        authoritative resolution for entities Phase 1 already covered.
        Only entities NOT in the table are re-resolved from scratch.

        v108 ROOT FIX (issue 68, COMPLETE): the v38 seed was
        NON-AUTHORITATIVE -- Phase 2 still re-resolved every input
        drug record through Phase 1's ``DrugResolver`` algorithm and
        adopted the freshly computed ``canonical_inchikey``, which
        could diverge from the persistent record on edge cases
        (stereoisomer collapse, salt-form detection disagreements).
        The v108 fix makes Phase 1's persistent ``entity_mapping``
        table AUTHORITATIVE for any input record that matches an
        existing entry (by ``drugbank_id``, ``chembl_id``,
        ``pubchem_cid``, or ``inchikey``):

          1. Build a source index from the persistent table
             (``_load_phase1_entity_mapping_source_index``).
          2. For each input drug record, look up its persistent
             ``canonical_inchikey``. If found, use it DIRECTLY -- do
             NOT re-resolve. Increment the ``reused_from_phase1``
             counter.
          3. Only records NOT in the persistent table get re-resolved
             via Phase 1's ``DrugResolver``. Increment the
             ``newly_resolved`` counter for each.
          4. After re-resolution, write the new mappings BACK to the
             persistent table (``_write_back_phase1_entity_mappings``)
             so future runs find them in the index.

        Backward compatibility: if the persistent table is empty or
        unreachable, every input record is re-resolved (the v38
        behavior) and no write-back is attempted. The new
        ``reused_from_phase1`` and ``newly_resolved`` counters in the
        returned stats dict let operators see the reuse ratio at a
        glance (healthy production: reused >> newly_resolved after
        the first run).

        Algorithm
        ---------
        1. Validate ``conflict_resolution`` (D2-018).
        2. Group edges by ``(src_id, rel_type, dst_id)``.
        3. For each group:
           - If group size > ``self._edge_dedup_threshold`` AND
             conflict_resolution is ``max_confidence`` or ``average``:
             trigger early reduction.
           - Early reduction (average): preserve ``_running_total_conf``
             and ``_running_total_count`` so subsequent reductions use
             the CORRECT sum (D7-003 fix).
           - Early reduction (max_confidence): keep only the current max.
           - Early reduction (union): keep first
             ``self._edge_dedup_threshold`` edges (memory bound).
        4. Final pass: materialize one merged edge per group.
           - Always include ``evidence_count`` and ``sources`` (D15-009).
           - Sort ``sources`` (D7-001).
           - Do NOT mutate input dicts (D7-004).
        5. Log at DEBUG for normal case, INFO for summary, WARNING if
           removal rate > 50% (D11-003).

        Parameters
        ----------
        edges : Iterable[dict]
            Each dict has keys ``src_id``, ``rel_type``, ``dst_id``,
            ``source`` (top-level), ``confidence`` (optional, default 0).
        conflict_resolution : str
            One of ``"max_confidence"``, ``"union"``, ``"average"``.
        profile_memory : bool
            If True, tracemalloc-wraps the operation and logs peak
            memory (D8-015).

        Returns
        -------
        list[dict]
            Deduplicated edges. Each edge is a NEW dict (caller's
            input is not mutated -- D7-004).

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``conflict_resolution`` is not one of the valid values
