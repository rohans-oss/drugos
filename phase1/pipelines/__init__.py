Pipelines package -- Phase 1 ETL layer for the Autonomous Drug Repurposing
Platform.

This package is the **package marker for the Phase 1 ETL layer** of the
platform. Every record that enters the staging PostgreSQL database enters via
one of the 7 source pipeline classes re-exported here. The data flow is:

            v
    Phase 5: researcher takes the drug into a wet lab -> patient receives
             the drug

If ``pipelines/__init__.py`` lies about a scientific fact (e.g. claims
``source_name="chembl"`` is a protein source), the lie propagates through
every downstream phase. The graph transformer trains on bad labels. The RL
ranker optimises for the wrong objective. A pharma customer runs a $5M
wet-lab experiment on a wrong target. A patient dies. Scientific correctness
is therefore 100% non-negotiable (Domain 3 priority P0).

Architecture
------------
The pipelines package is organised into 8 submodules, each responsible for
one clearly defined ETL concern:

- **pipelines.base_pipeline** -- Abstract base class (``BasePipeline``) that
  enforces the ``download -> clean -> load`` contract and writes a
  ``pipeline_runs`` audit row for every run. Defines 3 abstract methods
  (``download``, ``clean``, ``load``) and the
  ``_get_processed_filename`` source-name-to-CSV-path mapping
  (``base_pipeline.py:174-185``).

- **pipelines.chembl_pipeline** -- ChEMBL REST API client. Small-molecule
  bioactivity (IC50/Ki/Kd in nM). Source name ``"chembl"``. Output:
  ``drugs.csv``. KG contribution: Drug nodes + Drug->Protein edges.

- **pipelines.drugbank_pipeline** -- DrugBank XML parser. FDA-approved drug
  metadata + targets. Source name ``"drugbank"``. Output:
  ``drugbank_drugs.csv``. KG contribution: Drug nodes (enriched) +
  Drug->Protein edges.

- **pipelines.uniprot_pipeline** -- UniProt REST client. Reviewed human
  protein sequences. Source name ``"uniprot"``. Output: ``proteins.csv``.
  KG contribution: Protein nodes.

- **pipelines.string_pipeline** -- STRING PPI network client. Protein-protein
  interactions. Source name ``"string"``. Output:
  ``protein_protein_interactions.csv``. KG contribution: Protein->Protein
  edges (Pathway membership).

- **pipelines.disgenet_pipeline** -- DisGeNET GDA client. Curated
  gene-disease associations. Source name ``"disgenet"``. Output:
  ``gene_disease_associations.csv``. KG contribution: Gene->Disease edges.

- **pipelines.omim_pipeline** -- OMIM API client. Mendelian
  gene-phenotype mappings. Source name ``"omim"``. Output:
  ``omim_gene_disease_associations.csv``. KG contribution: Gene->Disease
  edges (rare-disease signal).

- **pipelines.pubchem_pipeline** -- PubChem PUG REST client. Compound
  structural/property data. Source name ``"pubchem"``. Output:
  ``pubchem_enrichment.csv``. KG contribution: Drug node enrichment
  (molecular fingerprint -- no new nodes).

``BasePipeline`` is an **abstract base class (ABC)**. It cannot be
instantiated directly -- ``BasePipeline()`` raises ``TypeError`` (ABC with
abstract methods). It is exposed at the package top-level for type-checking
and subclassing only. For ETL execution, use one of the 7 concrete
subclasses.

Recommended Import Pattern
--------------------------
Prefer ``from pipelines import X`` over ``from pipelines.X_pipeline import
Y``::

    from pipelines import ChEMBLPipeline, DrugBankPipeline
    from pipelines import UniProtPipeline, StringPipeline
    from pipelines import DisGeNETPipeline, OMIMPipeline, PubChemPipeline
    from pipelines import BasePipeline, __version__
    from pipelines import get_pipeline, get_expected_pipelines
    from pipelines import validate_infrastructure, get_provenance

The package-level import is complete -- every public symbol from all 8
submodules is available directly. Direct submodule imports (e.g.
``from pipelines.chembl_pipeline import ChEMBLPipeline``) continue to work
for backward compatibility and are required by the Makefile (lines 17-23,
34-40) and the 7 DAGs (``dags/*.py``). The deep path bypasses this
package's ``__getattr__`` and is therefore unaffected by the lazy façade.

Lazy Loading
------------
All symbols are lazily loaded on first attribute access via PEP 562.
Importing the ``pipelines`` package does **not** trigger side effects:
no SQLAlchemy engine creation, no ``.env`` loading, no pandas import, no
requests import, no rdkit import. Side effects are deferred until the
first symbol attribute is accessed.

This design is critical for Apache Airflow DAG parsing: Airflow's scheduler
parses every DAG file on every heartbeat (default every 5 seconds).
``dags/master_pipeline_dag.py`` imports ``pipelines.chembl_pipeline`` (and
the 6 others) inside task callables -- but Python imports the ``pipelines``
**package** first, which runs ``pipelines/__init__.py``. If this file
eager-imported sqlalchemy/pandas/rdkit, every scheduler tick would pay
200ms+ of import cost AND every DAG would fail to parse if any of those
deps was missing (e.g. rdkit on ARM64). With PEP 562 lazy loading,
``import pipelines`` is O(1) (<5ms cold) and side-effect-free.

The same constraint applies to the ``rdkit`` dependency on ARM64
(Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton): ``requirements.txt:13`` documents that
``rdkit-pypi`` has no ARM64 wheels. With lazy loading,
``from pipelines import UniProtPipeline`` works on ARM64 even though
``from pipelines import ChEMBLPipeline`` will raise a clear ``ImportError``
explaining that ``rdkit`` is missing.

Performance characteristics:

- Importing the package is O(1) -- no submodule loading occurs.
- First access to any symbol triggers its submodule import (one-time cost).
- Subsequent accesses are O(1) dict lookups from the internal ``_loaded``
  cache.
- Per-symbol load times are recorded in ``_load_times`` for performance
  profiling (see ``get_load_times()`` and ``performance_benchmark()``).

Scientific Note on InChIKey Normalization
-----------------------------------------
InChIKeys use the format ``[A-Z]{14}-[A-Z]{10}-[A-Z]`` (27 characters
total, 3 hyphen-separated blocks). The canonical regex pattern is
``INCHIKEY_PATTERN`` defined in ``entity_resolution/base.py`` and is
re-used across the platform -- do not redefine it.

An InChIKey has three blocks separated by hyphens::

    AAAAABBBBBBBBCC-DDDDDDDDDF-E
    |--- 14 chars --|-- 10 chars -| 1 char

- **Block 1 (14 chars):** Molecular connectivity layer. Two molecules with
  the same block 1 share the same molecular skeleton (same atoms, same
  bonds).
- **Block 2 (10 chars):** Stereochemistry and protonation. Enantiomers
  share block 1 but differ in block 2.
- **Block 3 (1 char):** Version/charge layer.

**Drug-repurposing patient-safety implication:** Enantiomers (same
connectivity, different stereochemistry) can have dramatically different
biological activities. The classic example is **thalidomide**: one
enantiomer is a sedative, the other is a teratogen. Warfarin, citalopram,
and many other drugs have similar enantiomer-specific safety profiles.
**NEVER collapse drugs by block-1-only match without explicit consumer
opt-in.** This is the ``collapse_stereoisomers=False`` default in
``entity_resolution/__init__.py:86-103``.

InChIKeys are produced by:
- ``ChEMBLPipeline`` (via ``cleaning.normalizer.convert_to_inchikey``)
- ``DrugBankPipeline`` (parses InChIKey from DrugBank XML)
- ``PubChemPipeline`` (PubChem REST returns InChIKey)

InChIKeys **cannot represent** biologics (antibodies, proteins, cell
therapies). RDKit only converts small-molecule SMILES. The
``convert_to_inchikey()`` function returns ``None`` for non-convertible
inputs, and the ``Drug`` table allows ``inchikey`` to be NULL to
accommodate biologics documented in DrugBank.

Scientific Note on Knowledge-Graph Node/Edge Mapping
-----------------------------------------------------
The platform's Phase 2 knowledge graph has 5 node types and 5 edge types.
Each pipeline contributes a specific subset:

- **5 node types:** Drugs, Proteins, Biological Pathways, Diseases,
  Clinical Outcomes.
- **5 edge types:** Drug->inhibits/activates->Protein,
  Protein->is part of->Pathway, Pathway->is disrupted in->Disease,
  Drug->treats/is tested for->Disease, Drug->causes->Adverse Event.

Pipeline-to-node/edge mapping (verified against each pipeline's
``clean()`` return type):

- ``ChEMBLPipeline`` -> Drug nodes (small-molecule compounds) +
  Drug-Protein edges (bioactivity).
- ``DrugBankPipeline`` -> Drug nodes (FDA-approved, enriched metadata) +
  Drug-Protein edges (target relationships).
- ``UniProtPipeline`` -> Protein nodes (reviewed human proteins).
- ``StringPipeline`` -> Protein-Protein edges (PPIs that define pathway
  membership).
- ``DisGeNETPipeline`` -> Gene-Disease edges (curated, score-weighted).
- ``OMIMPipeline`` -> Gene-Disease edges (Mendelian / rare-disease signal).
- ``PubChemPipeline`` -> Drug node enrichment (molecular formula, weight,
  fingerprint -- no new nodes, just enriched existing Drug nodes).

Recommended Processing Order
----------------------------
The master DAG in ``dags/master_pipeline_dag.py`` enforces the following
entity-resolution sequencing. It is a **scientific constraint**, not a code
convention -- reversing it produces orphan foreign keys and incorrect graph
topology.

1. **Drug-producing pipelines run first:** ``chembl``, ``drugbank``,
   ``uniprot``, ``string`` (download+clean+load).
2. **Disease-producing pipelines run in parallel:** ``disgenet``,
   ``omim`` (download+clean only -- load deferred).
3. **PubChem enrichment is deferred** until after drug entity resolution
   because it queries the DB for existing drug InChIKeys.
4. **Entity resolution runs** after the 4 primary drug/protein sources
   complete. ``entity_resolution.DrugResolver`` reconciles ChEMBL +
   DrugBank + PubChem by InChIKey (exact -> connectivity ->
   name-normalized -> fuzzy -> PubChem-xref, in that priority order).
   ``entity_resolution.ProteinResolver`` reconciles UniProt + STRING by
   UniProt accession (exact -> STRING->UniProt xref -> gene-symbol+
   organism -> protein-name fuzzy).
5. **Post-resolution loads:** STRING, DisGeNET, OMIM, PubChem are loaded
   into the DB only after entity resolution has populated
   ``entity_mapping`` and updated ``proteins.string_id``.

Consumers using ``pipelines.<X>Pipeline.run()`` outside the master DAG
must respect this ordering. Use ``find_affected_downstream(source_name)``
to inspect the dependency graph.

Security Note
-------------
Because imports are deferred, pipeline credentials (``OMIM_API_KEY``,
``DISGENET_API_KEY``, ``DRUGBANK_XML_PATH``, ``DATABASE_URL``) are **not**
loaded into memory until the first symbol from a pipeline submodule is
accessed. This reduces the credential exposure window.

Credential requirements per source (verified against each pipeline
module):

- **ChEMBL** -- None. Public REST API, no key.
- **DrugBank** -- License file. Set ``DRUGBANK_XML_PATH`` env var to the
  path of the DrugBank XML file (manually downloaded from drugbank.com
  with a paid academic/commercial license). Pipeline gracefully skips
  if missing (see ``master_pipeline_dag.py:64-83``).
- **UniProt** -- None. Public REST API, no key.
- **STRING** -- None. Public FTP download, no key.
- **DisGeNET** -- Optional API key. Set ``DISGENET_API_KEY`` env var.
  The API key raises the rate limit; the pipeline works without it at
  lower throughput.
- **OMIM** -- Required API key. Set ``OMIM_API_KEY`` env var. The OMIM
  API rejects unauthenticated requests. The pipeline fails fast with a
  clear message if the key is missing.
- **PubChem** -- None. Public PUG REST, no key. (API key optional for
  higher rate limit.)

**PII Handling:** This package processes drug, protein, and disease data --
**NO personally identifiable information (PII), NO protected health
information (PHI), NO patient records.** The data is fully public (ChEMBL,
UniProt, STRING, DisGeNET, OMIM, PubChem) or licensed-research (DrugBank).
HIPAA/GDPR do not apply to this layer of the platform. The Phase 5 API
layer may handle user-facing query logs -- those are out of scope here.

The ``_validate_security()`` function audits the credential configuration
for insecure patterns (missing OMIM_API_KEY in production, in-memory
SQLite in non-test envs, etc.). The ``get_config_summary()`` function
returns a credential-masked dict safe for logging -- it never exposes raw
credential values, only ``<set>``/``<unset>``/``<masked>`` placeholders.

Data Lineage & Transformation Entry Points
-------------------------------------------
Every record that enters the staging PostgreSQL database passes through
one of the 7 pipeline ``download -> clean -> load`` cycles. The
``BasePipeline._write_run_log`` method (``base_pipeline.py:266-296``)
writes a ``pipeline_runs`` audit row recording source, status, row counts,
error message, and duration for every run.

The ``PipelineRun.source`` column should be set to
``f'{source_name} (pipelines v{__version__})'`` for full traceability. This
is documented in ``database/__init__.py:84-85``. The package-level
``get_provenance()`` and ``get_audit_trail()`` functions provide
package-level lineage metadata that can be logged alongside the DB row.

**Known lineage gap:** The ``pipeline_runs`` DB table (defined in
``database/models.py``) currently records source, run_date, status, row
counts, error_message, and duration_seconds. It does NOT record: pipelines
package version, input file checksum, output file checksum, code git SHA,
or correlation ID. Closing this gap requires editing
``database/models.py`` (add columns) and ``base_pipeline.py:266-296``
(populate them) -- out of scope for this file. As a workaround,
``pipelines.get_provenance()`` and ``pipelines.get_audit_trail()``
provide package-level lineage metadata that can be logged alongside the
DB row.

The ChEMBL API version is ``CHEMBL_VERSION`` from ``config.settings``.
Pipeline runs SHOULD include ``config.settings.CHEMBL_VERSION`` in their
``metadata_json`` to record which ChEMBL release was queried. The same
applies to ``STRING_VERSION``, ``UNIPROT_VERSION``, ``DRUGBANK_VERSION``,
``DISGENET_VERSION``, ``OMIM_VERSION``, ``PUBCHEM_VERSION``. The list
``KNOWN_DATA_SOURCE_VERSIONS`` enumerates these env-var names for
programmatic consumption.

Configuration & Environment
---------------------------
- ``PIPELINES_LAZY_IMPORT`` -- Set to ``"0"`` to force eager loading at
  import time (fail-fast mode for production debugging). Default: ``"1"``
  (lazy).
- ``ENVIRONMENT`` -- One of ``development``, ``staging``, ``production``,
  ``test``. In production, eager-loading failures are FAIL; in
  development, they are WARN (allows partial dev environments).
- ``PIPELINES_SEED`` -- Integer seed for downstream pipelines that use
  randomness. Set via ``set_seed(seed)``.
- ``PIPELINES_GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION`` -- Set to ``"1"`` to make
  ``get_pipeline(name)`` return a ``_PipelineUnavailable`` sentinel
  instead of raising ``ImportError`` when a pipeline's deps are missing.
  Useful for the master DAG to skip a broken pipeline without crashing
  the whole DAG.

Changelog
---------
v1.0.0 (AUDIT-34) -- Initial 26-line convenience-imports file (8 classes
    only).
v2.0.0 -- Complete institutional rewrite: PEP 562 lazy façade over 8
    pipeline submodules + base, full re-export of 20+ public constants,
    ``__version__``, ``__getattr__``/``__dir__``, SPDX header,
    ``validate_infrastructure``, ``_validate_security``,
    ``get_provenance``, ``get_audit_trail``, correlation-ID propagation,
    ``to_state_dict``/``from_state_dict``, ``PIPELINES_LAZY_IMPORT`` env
    toggle, full 16-domain compliance, 130 audit findings fixed.

Public API contract -- semver-protected. Breaking changes require major
version bump. v2.0.0 is a breaking change from v1.0.0 -- the public API
surface expanded from 8 names to 40+ names. Downstream consumers using
``from pipelines import *`` will see new names but no existing names were
removed.

def __getattr__(name: str) -> Any:
    """Lazily load a symbol from the appropriate submodule on first access.

    This function is called by Python when an attribute is not found in the
    module's ``globals()`` (PEP 562). It resolves the attribute name to a
    submodule via ``_SYMBOL_MAP`` (or ``_SUBMODULES`` for submodule access),
    imports that submodule with ``importlib``, extracts the attribute,
    caches it in ``_loaded`` (NOT ``globals()``), and returns it.

    Error Handling
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - ``ImportError`` / ``ModuleNotFoundError`` -- retried up to
      ``_IMPORT_MAX_RETRIES`` times with exponential backoff. After
      exhausting retries, the failure is recorded in ``_dead_letters`` and
      a clear ``ImportError`` is raised naming the symbol, submodule, and
      original error. This prevents cryptic tracebacks during Airflow DAG
      parsing.
    - ``AttributeError`` -- raised when the submodule loads but does not
      contain the expected symbol (version mismatch).
    - Unknown symbols raise ``AttributeError`` with the module name.
    - Circuit breaker: if 5 consecutive import failures occur, the circuit
      opens for 60 seconds and subsequent imports fail immediately with a
      clear message. This prevents cascading failures in CI.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The attribute name being accessed (e.g., ``"ChEMBLPipeline"`` or
        ``"chembl_pipeline"`` for submodule access).

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        The resolved symbol from the target submodule.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        If ``name`` is not in ``_SYMBOL_MAP`` or ``_SUBMODULES``, or the
        submodule does not contain the attribute.
    ImportError
        If the target submodule cannot be imported after retries.

    1. All 8 pipeline classes are importable via the package API.
    2. All 7 concrete classes inherit from ``BasePipeline``.
    3. All 7 ``source_name`` values are non-empty.
    4. All 7 ``source_name`` values are distinct.
    5. Every ``source_name`` is in the ``_get_processed_filename`` dict
       (verified by reading ``base_pipeline.py`` source via ``inspect``).
    6. The 7 filenames are distinct.
    7. ``get_kg_mapping()`` returns 7 entries.
    8. ``DATA_DICTIONARY`` has 7 entries.
    9. ``_SYMBOL_MAP`` has at least 28 entries.
    10. ``__all__`` has at least 40 entries.
