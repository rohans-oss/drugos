Cleaning sub-package for the Drug Repurposing ETL Platform.

.. warning::
    **v29 ROOT FIX (audit C-12): 2377 lines of re-exports -- significant
    import-time cost.** This file is a mega-export ``__init__.py`` that
    re-exports ~80+ public symbols from four sub-modules
    (``normalizer``, ``deduplicator``, ``missing_values``, ``confidence``)
    plus a large amount of package-level glue code (exceptions, a
    circuit breaker, dead-letter store, audit/provenance helpers,
    metrics, fingerprinting, public-API declaration, etc.). The bulk of
    the file is *module-level documentation* (lines 1-444) plus a
    90-line ``__all__`` (lines 2287-2377) plus the
    ``_LAZY_IMPORTS`` / ``_OPTIONAL_DEPS`` / ``_API_VERSIONS`` registry
    tables (each ~100+ lines, each mirroring the same symbol list).

    Future cleanup (out of scope for v29): split this file into
    sub-packages -- e.g. ``cleaning.api``, ``cleaning.internals``,
    ``cleaning.registry`` -- and let consumers import from those. The
    current single-file design was acceptable when there were ~12
    symbols; at 80+ it has become a maintenance and import-time
    liability (importing ``cleaning`` parses ~2400 lines of module
    body). For now, the bloat is documented but unchanged -- deleting
    re-exports would break downstream pipelines (``omim_pipeline.py``,
    ``drugbank_pipeline.py``, etc.) and the existing
    ``__getattr__``/``_LAZY_IMPORTS`` machinery already defers the
    *expensive* sub-module imports until first attribute access.

    The most impactful follow-up would be to factor the multi-hundred-
    line docstring at the top of this file into ``cleaning/SCHEMA.md``
    (which already exists) and ``cleaning/MIGRATION.md`` (also exists).
    That alone would shave ~440 lines from the import-time parse cost.

This package re-exports the public API from its sub-modules so that
consumers can import functions directly from the ``cleaning`` namespace::

    from cleaning import convert_to_inchikey, dedup_by_inchikey

Re-exported symbols are listed in ``__all__``.  Every public name from
each sub-module's own ``__all__`` is re-exported here -- this package
does NOT selectively exclude any public name.

Sub-modules
-----------
normalizer
    SMILES to InChIKey conversion, InChIKey standardization, drug record
    normalization, activity value unit conversion.
deduplicator
    Drug deduplication by InChIKey, interaction deduplication by composite key.
missing_values
    InChIKey recovery from SMILES, missing drug field defaults,
    protein field cleaning, GDA score validation.

Recommended Processing Order
----------------------------
For drug DataFrames, apply cleaning in this order to ensure correctness:

1. ``standardize_inchikey`` -- normalize InChIKey format FIRST
2. ``handle_missing_inchikey`` -- recover missing InChIKeys from SMILES
3. ``fill_missing_drug_fields`` -- fill default values for missing fields
4. ``standardize_drug_record`` -- normalize drug type, FDA approval, etc.
5. ``dedup_by_inchikey`` -- deduplicate AFTER normalization (order matters!)

For protein DataFrames:

1. ``handle_missing_protein_fields`` -- drop null IDs, fill defaults,
   truncate sequences

For GDA DataFrames:

1. ``validate_gda_scores`` -- clip scores to [0,1], fill missing disease names

**WARNING:** Calling ``dedup_by_inchikey`` before ``standardize_inchikey``
will fail to detect duplicates that differ only in InChIKey formatting
(whitespace, casing), producing silently incorrect results.

Scientific Note on InChIKey Normalization
------------------------------------------
InChIKeys use the format [A-Z]{14}-[A-Z]{10}-[A-Z] (27 characters total).
The first 14 characters represent the molecular connectivity layer -- two
molecules with the same connectivity block share the same molecular skeleton.
The remaining characters encode stereochemistry and protonation.

**Ordering matters:** ``dedup_by_inchikey`` MUST be called AFTER
``standardize_inchikey``, because the same drug may appear with InChIKeys
that differ only in whitespace or casing.  Without normalization, chemically
identical drugs are treated as distinct, inflating drug counts and fragmenting
interaction data.

InChIKey Structure and Drug Repurposing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An InChIKey has three blocks separated by hyphens::

  AAAAABBBBBBBBCC-DDDDDDDDDF-E
  |--- 14 chars --|-- 10 chars -| 1 char

- Block 1 (14 chars): Molecular connectivity layer.  Two molecules with
  the same block 1 share the same molecular skeleton (same atoms, same bonds).
- Block 2 (10 chars): Stereochemistry and protonation.  Enantiomers share
  block 1 but differ in block 2.
- Block 3 (1 char): Version/charge layer.

**Drug repurposing implication:** Enantiomers (same connectivity, different
stereochemistry) can have dramatically different biological activities.  The
classic example is thalidomide: one enantiomer is therapeutic, the other is
teratogenic.  The ``standardize_inchikey`` function validates the FULL 27-char
InChIKey, preserving stereochemistry information.  When comparing drugs for
deduplication, only drugs with IDENTICAL full InChIKeys are considered
duplicates.  Drugs that share only the connectivity block are NOT duplicates --
they may have different pharmacological profiles.

.. note::
   ``convert_to_inchikey`` CANNOT handle biologics (antibodies, proteins,
   cell therapies).  RDKit only converts small-molecule SMILES to InChIKeys.
   For biologics, use UniProt IDs or other protein-level identifiers instead.

Why Nanomolar (nM)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In pharmacology, nM is the standard unit for IC50/Ki/Kd measurements because
most drug-target interactions of therapeutic relevance fall in the nanomolar
range (1-100 nM).  The conversion factors are:

  - pM to nM:  divide by 1,000   (1 pM = 0.001 nM)
  - nM to nM:  identity           (1 nM = 1 nM)
  - uM to nM:  multiply by 1,000 (1 uM = 1,000 nM)
  - mM to nM:  multiply by 1e6   (1 mM = 1,000,000 nM)

A typical strong drug-target interaction has IC50 approximately 10 nM.
A weak interaction has IC50 approximately 10,000 nM (10 uM).
Values above 100 uM (100,000 nM) are generally considered non-specific.

Scientific Assumptions & Limitations
-------------------------------------
1. ``handle_missing_inchikey`` DROPS drugs that cannot be identified by
   either InChIKey or SMILES.  This means the final dataset may be missing
   entire drug classes (biologics, antibodies, cell therapies) that lack
   SMILES representations.  For small-molecule-centric analyses this is
   acceptable; for broad drug class coverage, consumers must supplement
   with alternative identifiers (e.g., UniProt IDs for biologics).

2. ``validate_gda_scores`` CLIPS scores to [0, 1].  This assumes all GDA
   scores are normalized.  Some data sources (e.g., DisGeNET) use different
   scoring scales.  Consumers should verify that their source scores are
   on a [0, 1] scale before relying on this function; if not, they must
   pre-normalize before calling this function.

3. ``fill_missing_drug_fields`` defaults ``is_fda_approved`` to ``False``.
   This is a CONSERVATIVE assumption that excludes drugs approved by other
   regulatory agencies (EMA, PMDA, TGA, Health Canada).  Consumers working
   with non-US drug data should override this default.

4. ``handle_missing_protein_fields`` defaults ``organism`` to
   ``'Homo sapiens'``.  This is correct for the primary use case (human
   drug repurposing) but will MISLABEL non-human proteins (veterinary,
   bacterial, plant).  Consumers processing non-human data MUST explicitly
   set the organism field before calling this function.

5. ``convert_to_inchikey`` uses RDKit which only handles small-molecule
   SMILES.  Antibodies, proteins, and cell-based therapies do not have
   SMILES representations and will return None.  This is not a bug -- it
   reflects a fundamental limitation of the SMILES/InChIKey system for
   biologics.

Error Behavior
--------------
Each cleaning function follows one of these error patterns:

1. **DataFrame functions** (dedup_by_inchikey, fill_missing_drug_fields, etc.):
   - Return a (possibly modified) COPY of the input DataFrame
   - Never return None
   - Log warnings for missing columns and return DataFrame unchanged
   - Log info for operations that modify data

2. **Conversion functions** (convert_to_inchikey, standardize_inchikey):
   - Return None if conversion fails
   - Log debug for expected failures (empty input, non-string)
   - Log warning for unexpected failures (RDKit errors)

3. **Value normalization** (normalize_activity_value):
   - Return (value, original_units) if conversion fails
   - Never raise for invalid input
   - Log debug for unrecognised units

4. **Package-level functions** (clean_drugs, check_health):
   - Raise KeyError for unknown step names
   - Raise SchemaValidationError for invalid input types
   - Never silently fail

Configuration
-------------
The cleaning package can be configured through:

1. **Environment variables:**

   - ``CLEANING_LAZY_IMPORTS=1`` -- Enable lazy imports (default: 1)
   - ``CLEANING_SKIP_RDKIT=1`` -- Skip RDKit import entirely (default: 0)
   - ``CLEANING_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`` -- Set package-wide log level

2. **Programmatic configuration:**

   - ``cleaning.configure(fuzzy_threshold=0.8)`` -- Override defaults
   - ``cleaning.configure(max_sequence_length=5000)`` -- Override defaults

3. **Health and validation:**

   - ``cleaning.check_health()`` -- Check which features are available
   - ``cleaning.validate_environment()`` -- Check runtime requirements
   - ``cleaning.validate_all_exports()`` -- Verify all exports are valid

Scalability Characteristics
---------------------------
- ``dedup_by_inchikey``: O(n log n) -- sorts the entire DataFrame by InChIKey.
  Memory: 2x input (working copy + sort).  Tested up to 1M rows.
- ``handle_missing_inchikey``: O(n) with expensive RDKit call per row
  (10-100ms per SMILES).  For 10K rows with missing InChIKeys, expect
  100-1000 seconds.  Consider batching for larger datasets.
- ``convert_to_inchikey``: O(1) per call, but 10-100ms per SMILES.
  Not vectorized -- each call creates a new RDKit Mol object.
- ``dedup_interactions``: O(n log n) -- sorts by composite key + activity.
- ``fill_missing_drug_fields``: O(n) -- single pass per column.
- ``validate_gda_scores``: O(n) -- vectorized clip operation.

Memory: All functions create a copy of the input DataFrame.
For datasets >1M rows, consider processing in chunks.

Design Decisions
----------------
1. **Why re-export ALL public names from sub-modules?**
   The package re-exports every name listed in each sub-module's ``__all__``.
   This eliminates the "which import path should I use?" ambiguity.  If a name
   is public in a sub-module, it should be public at the package level too.

2. **Why lazy imports by default?**
   The cleaning package is imported by Airflow DAG files, which are parsed
   every 30 seconds.  Eager imports of pandas, numpy, and RDKit add
   500ms-5s per DAG parse cycle.  Lazy imports reduce this to near-zero.

3. **Why is ALLOWED_TYPES re-exported?**
   The ChEMBL pipeline imports it directly from ``cleaning.normalizer``.
   This creates two inconsistent API surfaces.  Re-exporting it at the
   package level makes ``from cleaning import ALLOWED_TYPES`` the canonical
   path.

4. **Why does ``fill_missing_drug_fields`` use ``None`` for max_phase
   instead of 0?**
   None means "unknown" -- we don't know if the drug has clinical data.
   0 means "confirmed no clinical data."  These are semantically different.
   Using None preserves this distinction for downstream consumers.

- handle_missing_inchikey: requires 'inchikey' column; uses 'smiles' if present
- fill_missing_drug_fields: no required columns (fills optional ones)
- handle_missing_protein_fields: requires 'uniprot_id' column
- validate_gda_scores: uses 'score', 'disease_name', 'disease_id',
  'association_type' if present

API Stability
-------------
Names in ``__all__`` are considered STABLE -- they will not be removed or
have their behavior changed in a backward-incompatible way without:

1. A deprecation warning for at least one minor version
2. A migration guide in the CHANGELOG
3. The ``_API_VERSIONS`` dict being updated

Internal names (prefixed with _) are PRIVATE and may change without notice.

Dependency Compatibility
------------------------
- pandas >= 1.5, < 3.0
- numpy >= 1.20
- rdkit-pypi >= 2022.03  (x86_64 only; not available on ARM)
- rapidfuzz >= 3.0
- Python >= 3.9

Platform Compatibility
----------------------
- **Linux x86_64**: Fully supported (including RDKit)
- **macOS x86_64**: Fully supported (including RDKit)
- **macOS ARM (Apple Silicon)**: Partial -- RDKit may not be available
  via pip; install via conda or use CLEANING_SKIP_RDKIT=1
- **Windows**: Not officially tested; path handling may have issues
- **AWS Graviton (ARM)**: Partial -- same RDKit limitation as Apple Silicon

Access Control Note
-------------------
This package provides BOTH read-only cleaning functions (standardize_inchikey,
normalize_activity_value) and MUTATING cleaning functions (handle_missing_inchikey,
fill_missing_drug_fields, dedup_by_inchikey) that can drop records or overwrite
values with defaults.

In regulated environments (FDA 21 CFR Part 11, GxP), record deletion operations
must be auditable and restricted to authorized personnel.  This package does NOT
enforce access control -- it relies on the calling pipeline to enforce permissions.

Recommended practice: Wrap the cleaning package in a permission-gated facade
in production environments.

PII Handling Guidance
---------------------
The cleaning functions process drug, protein, and disease data.  In clinical
contexts, this data could contain patient-identifiable information (e.g.,
a drug named after a patient in a case study, or a disease association with
a specific patient's genetic variant).

This package does NOT perform PII detection.  It is the caller's responsibility
to:

1. Strip PII from input data BEFORE passing it to cleaning functions
2. Anonymize or aggregate data that could identify individuals
3. Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or other applicable regulations

If you are processing clinical data, use a PII detection tool (e.g.,
Microsoft Presidio) before the cleaning pipeline.

Secrets Management
------------------
The cleaning package does NOT use any secrets, API keys, or credentials
directly.  However, its transitive dependency chain includes:

- rdkit: Some commercial RDKit builds require a license key
- pandas/numpy: No secrets involved
- rapidfuzz: No secrets involved

If RDKit requires a license key, ensure it is stored in an environment
variable (e.g., RDKIT_LICENSE_PATH) or a secrets manager, NOT in source
code.  This package does not read or manage any license keys.

Regulatory Compliance
---------------------
This cleaning pipeline processes biomedical data that may be subject to:

- **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** (Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures):
  The audit trail and provenance tracking features support compliance
  by recording all data transformations.

- **GxP Guidelines** (Good Practice):
  The idempotent design and reproducibility features (fingerprinting,
  versioning) support validated data processing.

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation):
  If processing EU patient data, PII must be removed BEFORE entering
  the cleaning pipeline.  This package does not perform PII detection.

- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):
  Protected Health Information (PHI) must be de-identified before
  processing.  The data masking utilities (_mask_sensitive) support
  this but do not guarantee compliance.

Consumers in regulated environments should:

1. Enable audit logging (use _audit_log for all operations)
2. Use compute_data_fingerprint() for input/output verification
3. Maintain the provenance metadata (_provenance in DataFrame.attrs)
4. Implement access control at the pipeline level

Structured Logging Convention
-----------------------------
All cleaning package log messages follow this format::

  FUNCTION_NAME: description -- detail (N rows in, M rows out)

Log levels:

  DEBUG   -- Internal state, skipped steps, empty DataFrames
  INFO    -- Operations completed, rows affected, metrics
  WARNING -- Anomalies that don't stop processing (missing columns, bad values)
  ERROR   -- Operations that failed (import failures, dependency issues)
  CRITICAL -- System-level failures that make the package unusable

Every operation log MUST include:

1. The function name (for filtering)
2. Row counts before/after (for data quality tracking)
3. Specific details about what changed

Coding Standards
----------------
This package follows:

- **PEP 8** -- Style Guide for Python Code
- **PEP 257** -- Docstring Conventions
- **PEP 328** -- Imports: Multi-Line and Absolute/Relative (using relative imports)
- **PEP 562** -- Module __getattr__ and __dir__ (lazy loading)
- **PEP 561** -- Distributing and Packaging Type Information (py.typed marker)
- **numpydoc** -- Docstring format (Parameters, Returns, Examples sections)

Examples
--------
Complete drug cleaning pipeline::

    >>> from cleaning import clean_drugs
    >>> cleaned = clean_drugs(raw_drugs_df)

Step-by-step with custom ordering::

    >>> from cleaning import (
    ...     standardize_inchikey,
    ...     handle_missing_inchikey,
    ...     fill_missing_drug_fields,
    ...     standardize_drug_record,
    ...     dedup_by_inchikey,
    ... )
    >>> df = standardize_inchikey(df)
    >>> df = handle_missing_inchikey(df)
    >>> df = fill_missing_drug_fields(df)
    >>> df = standardize_drug_record(df)
    >>> df = dedup_by_inchikey(df)

Check package health before processing::

    >>> from cleaning import check_health
    >>> health = check_health()
    >>> if health["status"] != "healthy":
    ...     print("Some features unavailable:", health)

    FIX-F / C-18: this function now AGGREGATES dead letters from ALL

      * ``cleaning`` (package-level ``_dead_letters``)
      * ``cleaning.deduplicator._dead_letters``
      * ``cleaning.missing_values._dead_letters``

    Previously it returned ONLY the package-level queue, silently
    dropping dead letters raised inside the deduplicator (e.g., dropped
    duplicates from ``dedup_interactions``) and missing-value handlers
    (e.g., rows that failed imputation). The audit (C-18) found three
    parallel queues with no unified view -- operators had to call
    ``deduplicator.get_dead_letters()`` and ``missing_values.get_dead_letters()``
    separately to see the full failure set. This function now returns
    the union so a single call captures every dead letter.

    The aggregation is read-only -- entries are NOT moved or copied
    between queues. Each submodule keeps its own queue (preserving the
    per-module bounded-FIFO eviction semantics); this function simply
    concatenates snapshots.

# Cleaning metadata tracking (GUARD-DQ5, GAP-DQ6)
# ===========================================================================
# P2-5 ROOT FIX (v82): the previous implementation added a
# ``_cleaning_applied`` COLUMN to every cleaned DataFrame, accumulating
# step names ("standardize_inchikey;handle_missing_inchikey;..."). This
# column was NOT in the documented output schema (see the Data Dictionary
# above at line ~252) and silently polluted every downstream consumer:
#   * DB loaders rejected the row (CHECK constraint violations) or
#     silently included the column in the DB (schema drift).
#   * Knowledge-graph ingestion in phase2 saw an extra column that
#     broke Cypher property-list construction.
#   * Fingerprint reproducibility (IDEM-7) was broken because the
#     column contains per-row timestamps.
#
# The ROOT FIX stores cleaning-step metadata in ``df.attrs`` (the
# pandas metadata dict) -- a SIDE-CHANNEL that does NOT appear in
# ``df.columns`` and is therefore invisible to schema-validation /
# DB-loaders / fingerprint computation. ``df.attrs`` is the canonical
# pandas mechanism for attaching metadata to a DataFrame.
#
# Backward-compat:
#   * The ``_CLEANING_METADATA_COL`` constant is kept for any external
#     code that references the name (it's the column name we WOULD use
#     if the opt-in env var is set).
#   * If ``CLEANING_TRACK_APPLIED_STEPS=1`` is set, the column IS
#     added (opt-in for operators who want it). Default OFF.
#   * ``_is_already_cleaned`` checks ``df.attrs`` FIRST (canonical),
#     then falls back to the column for input DataFrames that already
#     have it (e.g. re-cleaning a previously-cleaned frame).

# import-time cost. Future cleanup: split into sub-packages. For now,
# documented the bloat. The actual sub-module imports are deferred via
# the ``_LAZY_IMPORTS`` dict + module-level ``__getattr__`` above so
# that ``import cleaning`` does NOT eagerly load pandas/numpy/rdkit.
