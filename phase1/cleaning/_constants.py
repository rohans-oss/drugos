"""Shared constants for the cleaning module (v16 ROOT FIX for CD-7).

Why this file exists
--------------------
Before v16, two modules defined ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` with DIFFERENT
values:

- ``cleaning/normalizer.py`` defined ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX = 1e6``
  (1 mM) -- beyond this, a value was marked ``censored=True`` ("we know
  it's > X") because 1 mM is the upper limit of pharmacological
  relevance.
- ``cleaning/deduplicator.py`` defined ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX = 1e9``
  (1 M) -- beyond this, a value was filtered out as "non-physical"
  (concentrations above 1 M are chemically impossible in aqueous
  biological assays).

A value of e.g. ``5e7 nM`` (50 mM) was therefore ``censored=True``
in normalizer but ``valid`` in deduplicator -- a 3-order-of-magnitude
inconsistency that meant the same activity record had different
"valid" status depending on which module inspected it. Downstream
TransE training saw a biased sample.

v16 fix: this module exposes TWO clearly-named constants so the
distinction is explicit and both modules import from here:

- ``ACTIVITY_VALUE_CENSORED_THRESHOLD = 1e6``  (1 mM -- above this,
  a value is flagged as "censored: > X" because it exceeds the
  pharmacologically relevant range)
- ``ACTIVITY_VALUE_NON_PHYSICAL_THRESHOLD = 1e9``  (1 M -- above this,
  a value is rejected as non-physical / corrupt)

Both modules now reference these shared constants; no module defines
its own ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX``.

v29 ROOT FIX (Compound Chain 3 -- InChIKey Validation Divergence):
The forensic audit found that normalizer.py accepted 28+ char
suffixed InChIKeys (`(?:-[A-Za-z0-9]+)?` block), while
deduplicator.py required strict 27-char (`^[A-Z]{14}-[A-Z]{10}-[A-Z]$`).
A valid InChIKey could pass cleaning, fail dedup, fail DB insert.
An invalid InChIKey could pass cleaning, pass dedup, fail DB insert.
The DB CHECK was even more permissive (LENGTH=27 OR SYNTH%). This
3-way divergence caused silent data loss at every stage.

ROOT FIX: define ONE canonical regex here. All modules import from
this single source of truth. The regex is the IUPAC standard
InChIKey format: 14 uppercase letters, hyphen, 10 uppercase letters,
hyphen, 1 uppercase letter (the version char -- usually S or N, but
the spec allows any uppercase letter for forward compatibility).
Protonation / tautomeric suffixes (`-a`, `-b`) are NOT part of the
canonical InChIKey -- they're an IUPAC extension and should be
stripped BEFORE validation, not accepted by the regex. This is the
audited, scientifically-correct behavior.

ACTIVITY_VALUE_NON_PHYSICAL_THRESHOLD: float = 1e9

# v65 ROOT FIX (P1C-014 -- misleading alias name):
#   The previous alias was named ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` and pointed at
#   the CENSORED threshold (1e6 = 1 mM). The name ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX``
#   suggested it was the ABSOLUTE maximum valid value, but the actual
#   non-physical rejection threshold is 1e9 (1 M) -- 3 orders of magnitude
#   higher. A legacy caller importing ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` from this
#   module expecting the deduplicator's rejection threshold (1e9) got 1e6
#   instead, silently dropping valid activity measurements in
#   [1e6, 1e9) nM. The audit (P1C-014) flagged this as a compound issue:
#   ``deduplicator.py`` previously defined its OWN ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX``
#   = 1e9 (non-physical), so the SAME name meant two different things in
#   two modules.
#   ROOT FIX:
#     1. Rename the alias to ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_CENSORED_MAX_LEGACY`` --
#        the name now states exactly what it is (the CENSORED threshold,
#        kept for legacy backward compatibility).
#     2. Keep ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` as a backward-compat alias pointing
#        at the renamed constant, with a prominent deprecation comment
#        so future callers see the clearer name. The value is UNCHANGED
#        (1e6) -- only the canonical name is new.
#     3. ``deduplicator.py`` no longer defines its own
#        ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` (the 1e9 shadow was removed in the same
#        v65 fix). The only modules that still define
#        ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` are this module (1e6, censored) and
#        ``normalizer.py`` (1e6, censored) -- both agree. No module
#        defines ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` as 1e9 anymore.
_ACTIVITY_VALUE_CENSORED_MAX_LEGACY: float = ACTIVITY_VALUE_CENSORED_THRESHOLD

# Backward-compat alias -- DEPRECATED. Use
# ``_ACTIVITY_VALUE_CENSORED_MAX_LEGACY`` (clear name) or, better, the
# fully-explicit ``ACTIVITY_VALUE_CENSORED_THRESHOLD`` /
# ``ACTIVITY_VALUE_NON_PHYSICAL_THRESHOLD`` constants directly. This alias
# is kept ONLY so legacy callers that do ``from cleaning._constants import
# _ACTIVITY_VALUE_MAX`` continue to work; it will be removed in a future
# major release.

# v35 ROOT FIX: canonical OMIM disease ID regex (single source of truth)
# ============================================================================
#
# v104 FORENSIC ROOT FIX (P1-005 -- OMIM MIM-number range diverges across
#   3 modules):
#   The previous code accepted 4-7 digit MIM numbers (``^[0-9]{4,7}$``).
#   This diverged from BOTH:
#     - omim_pipeline.py:701 which validates ``100100 <= mim <= 999999``
#       (strict 6-digit OMIM range per OMIM's own numbering convention).
#     - disgenet_pipeline.py:418 which used ``_OMIM_MIM_MAX = 9999999``
#       (7-digit, allowing forward-expansion that OMIM has never used).
#   When DisGeNET loaded a 7-digit MIM (which does not exist in current
#   OMIM data), the OMIM pipeline rejected it during cross-source
#   validation, silently dropping the disease. The KG then had the
#   disease from DisGeNET but not from OMIM -- and the entity resolver
#   could not merge them because the MIM formats did not match. Disease
#   nodes were duplicated in the KG, GNN assigned different embeddings
#   to the same disease, and the RL ranker could rank the same drug
#   twice for the same disease under different MIM aliases.
#
#   ROOT FIX: standardize on the OMIM canonical format -- 6 digits,
#   numeric range [100100, 999999]. The regex ``^[1-9][0-9]{5}$``
#   enforces 6 digits starting with 1-9 (covers all OMIM ranges:
#   100100-199999 autosomal dominant, 200000-299999 autosomal recessive,
#   300000-399999 X-linked, 400000-499999 Y-linked, 500000-599999
#   mitochondrial, 600000-999999 post-1994 autosomal loci). The
#   numeric range check [100100, 999999] is the second layer (rejects
#   100000-100099 which match the regex but are below OMIM's first
#   official phenotype MIM). All three modules (omim_pipeline,
#   disgenet_pipeline, _constants) now import this SAME regex and the
#   SAME range constants.
#
#   The issue brief suggested ``^1[0-9]{6}$`` (strict 6-digit starting
#   with 1) -- but that regex would reject ALL legitimate MIMs starting
#   with 2-9 (e.g. 600000-series post-1994 loci which are the BULK of
#   current OMIM entries). We use the scientifically-correct
#   ``^[1-9][0-9]{5}$`` instead, combined with the [100100, 999999]
#   numeric range check.

    v107 FORENSIC ROOT FIX (ISSUE-P1-020):
      The regex ``CANONICAL_OMIM_DISEASE_ID_REGEX`` accepts any 6-digit
      number starting with 1-9 (``[1-9][0-9]{5}``). This includes

      applied. Previously, the range check was enforced ONLY in
      ``omim_pipeline.py:701``, NOT in the regex itself or in any shared
      validator. A 6-digit number like ``100050`` passed the regex but was
      not a real OMIM phenotype MIM -- it silently slipped through other

# v29 ROOT FIX (audit D-4): canonical UniProt accession regex
# ============================================================================
#
# The DB layer (models.py ``Protein.uniprot_id``) keeps a portable,
# SQLite-compatible LENGTH-based CHECK constraint because SQLite does not
# support regex CHECKs natively. The STRICT canonical regex is enforced at
# the Python layer instead, by ``database.models._validate_uniprot_id``
# (which delegates to ``entity_resolution.resolver_utils._UNIPROT_ACCESSION_RE``
# -- same pattern).
#
# Why a separate canonical regex here:
#   * Audit D-4 found that the DB CHECK only enforces ``LENGTH 4-10`` and
#     therefore lets any short alphanumeric string (e.g. a mouse-organism
#     identifier or a stray ``MOUSE1`` token) sneak into the human protein
#     set. The Python validator already rejects these via the strict regex,
#     but the regex was previously only defined in
#     ``entity_resolution.resolver_utils`` -- invisible to anyone reading the
#     DB layer. Declaring it here (single source of truth, mirroring the
#     InChIKey pattern above) makes the canonical contract explicit and
#     importable from any module.
#
# Two variants are exposed:
#   * ``CANONICAL_UNIPROT_ACCESSION_REGEX`` -- the audit-D-4 spec verbatim:
#     ``^[OPQ][0-9][A-Z0-9]{3}[0-9]([A-Z0-9]{3}[0-9]){1,5}$``. This is the

#     once, so it matches 10-26-char accessions only. It is intended for
#     caller code that explicitly wants to accept ONLY the long form.
#   * ``CANONICAL_UNIPROT_ACCESSION_REGEX_FULL`` -- the operational form
#     that ALSO accepts canonical 6-char accessions (e.g. P69999, Q9Y6K9).
#     This is what ``models._validate_uniprot_id`` and

# v29 ROOT FIX (audit P1-24): canonical ID normalization utilities
# ============================================================================
#
# Each of the 7 ingestion pipelines (chembl, drugbank, uniprot, string,
# disgenet, omim, pubchem) writes a slightly different ID format for the
# SAME biological entity. Cross-source joins (e.g. ChEMBL.drug × DrugBank.drug
# on InChIKey; STRING.PPI × UniProt.protein on uniprot_id; DisGeNET × OMIM
# on gene_symbol) silently fail when one source writes
# ``"BSYNRYMUTXBXSQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N"`` and another writes
# ``"bsynrymutxbxsq-uhfffaoysa-n"``; or when one source writes ``"P23219"``
# and another writes ``"p23219"``.
#
# ROOT FIX: this module exposes one canonical normalizer per ID type. The
# 7 pipelines call them at their OUTPUT boundary (right before persist /
# return) so every CSV shipped downstream has the SAME canonical form,
# regardless of which source produced it.
#
# These functions are deliberately MINIMAL -- they enforce case + whitespace
# only. Format validation (regex, length, checksum) remains the job of the
# pipeline-specific validators (which import the CANONICAL_*_REGEX constants
# above). Splitting "shape" from "case" keeps the normalizers idempotent
# and side-effect-free, which is required because some pipelines already
# run their own validators (e.g. ChEMBL's ``_step_standardize_inchikeys``).
# Calling normalize_*() on already-normalized data is a no-op.
#
# The ``normalize_pubchem_cid`` function returns ``Optional[int]`` (not str)

def normalize_inchikey(s: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Normalize an InChIKey to canonical form.

    - Uppercase (InChIKey hash chars are uppercase by IUPAC spec).
    - Strip leading/trailing whitespace.
    - Non-string inputs are coerced via ``str()``.

    Returns ``None`` for ``None`` input so callers can decide how to handle
    missing values (the canonical regex will reject ``None`` as invalid).
    This is aligned with ``normalizer.py``'s ``normalize_inchikey`` which
    also returns ``None`` for ``None`` input (v35 root fix -- the previous
    ``""`` sentinel created a divergence between the two normalizers that
    caused ``None`` values to be silently written as empty strings into
    the cleaned CSV).

    v38 ROOT FIX (Phase 1 Issue #30): the other ID normalizers
    (``normalize_uniprot_id``, ``normalize_drugbank_id``,
    ``normalize_chembl_id``, ``normalize_gene_symbol``) return ``""``
    for ``None`` input, while ``normalize_inchikey`` returns ``None``.
    This divergence forces downstream code to special-case InChIKey.
    The fix is NOT to change the return values (that would break
    callers) but to document the divergence prominently and provide a
    uniform truthiness check: ``if not normalized_value: skip`` works
    for BOTH ``None`` and ``""`` (both are falsy). Downstream code
    should use truthiness checks, not ``is None`` checks, to handle
    both sentinels uniformly.

    P1-042 v113 ROOT FIX: the type hint was ``-> str`` but the function
    actually returns ``str | None`` (returns None for None input). A
    static type checker (mypy, pyright) would flag downstream code that
    assigns the result to a ``str`` variable. A developer who reads the
    ``-> str`` hint may write ``normalize_inchikey(raw).upper()`` which
    crashes on ``None``. ROOT FIX: change the type hint to
    ``Optional[str]`` (both parameter and return) so static analysis
    matches the actual behavior.
