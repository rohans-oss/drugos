"""Migration management package for the Drug Repurposing ETL Platform.

This package provides a cross-dialect schema migration system that handles
PostgreSQL and SQLite. It manages three migration files (001-003) that
define the complete database schema, constraints, and data transformations.

Public API
----------
- run_migrations(engine, config) -> MigrationResult
    Apply pending schema migrations. Supports dry-run mode, callback hooks,
    and dependency injection for testability.

- check_migrations(engine) -> MigrationHealthResult
    Verify all migrations are applied and schema version matches.

- get_migration_status(engine) -> MigrationStatus
    Detailed status of applied and pending migrations.

- MigrationConfig
    Configuration dataclass for customizing migration behavior.

- MigrationResult
    Result dataclass returned by run_migrations().

- MigrationError
    Custom exception raised when one or more migrations fail.

Migration Files
---------------
- 001_initial_schema.sql -- Creates all 7 core tables
- 002_bug_fixes_migration.sql -- Adds columns, deduplicates, adds constraints
- 003_models_fix_migration.sql -- 78-issue scientific/design/quality fix

Cross-Dialect Support
---------------------
- PostgreSQL: Full SQL migrations via SQLAlchemy text() execution
- SQLite: Column additions via Python inspect() + ALTER TABLE

Dialect Behavior Matrix
-----------------------
+-----------------------+------------+---------+
| Operation             | PostgreSQL | SQLite  |
+=======================+============+=========+
| SQL file execution    | Yes        | No      |
| Column additions      | Yes        | Yes     |
| CHECK constraints     | Yes        | Limited |
| FK constraints        | Yes        | Yes*    |
| Migration tracking    | Yes        | Yes     |
| Unique indexes        | Yes        | Yes     |
+-----------------------+------------+---------+
* SQLite FK requires PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON

Known Limitations
-----------------
- No rollback/downgrade support (planned Alembic migration)
- SQL migrations only execute on PostgreSQL (column additions work on both)
- No automatic schema diff between ORM models and database
- Migrations are intentionally sequential. Migration 002 depends on
  tables created by 001. Migration 003 depends on columns/constraints
  from 002. Parallel execution would violate these dependencies and
  could corrupt the schema.

Why Not Alembic?
----------------
The current cross-dialect Python migration runner was chosen over Alembic
for Phase 1 speed-to-delivery: it requires no additional dependencies,
integrates directly with the existing SQLAlchemy setup, and handles the
project's two-dialect requirement (PostgreSQL + SQLite for testing).

Limitations of the current approach (planned for Alembic migration):
- No automatic schema generation from ORM models
- No rollback/downgrade support
- No dependency graph between migrations
- No automatic migration generation

Migration to Alembic is planned for Phase 2/3 when the schema stabilizes.

Adding a New Migration
----------------------
1. Create a new file: NNN_description.sql (NNN = 3-digit sequential number)
2. Wrap the SQL in BEGIN; ... COMMIT;
3. Use IF NOT EXISTS / IF EXISTS for idempotent DDL
4. Test on both PostgreSQL and SQLite
5. Bump SCHEMA_VERSION in database/base.py
6. Add a corresponding entry in schema_version table
7. Run: python -m database.migrations

Troubleshooting Failed Migrations
---------------------------------
1. Check _migration_history: SELECT * FROM _migration_history ORDER BY id
2. Check _failed_migrations for error details
3. For checksum drift: re-apply with MIGRATIONS_REQUIRE_CHECKSUM=0
4. For constraint violations: check data with validate_scientific_constraints()
5. Last resort: restore from database backup

Data Compliance
---------------
This module modifies database tables that may contain data subject to
regulatory requirements:

GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation):
- Gene-disease associations reference gene symbols, which are NOT
  considered personal data under GDPR Recital 26 (not identifying
  a natural person).
- Pipeline run metadata does not contain PII.
- All data is sourced from public, freely available databases.

HIPAA (US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):
- This platform does NOT process Protected Health Information (PHI).
- All data is population-level, not patient-level.
- No dates of birth, SSNs, medical record numbers, or health plan
  beneficiary numbers are stored.

Audit Trail:
- _migration_history records who, when, and what was applied.
- _failed_migrations records failures for forensic investigation.
- Row count changes are logged before and after each migration.

Data Classification
-------------------
Tables modified by migrations contain the following data classifications:
- drugs: Public chemical/drug data (no PII)
- proteins: Public protein data (no PII)
- gene_disease_associations: Gene-disease associations. Gene symbols
  are NOT PII under GDPR, but disease associations for specific
  individuals COULD be. This table stores population-level data
  sourced from public databases, not individual patient data.
- pipeline_runs: Operational metadata (no PII)
- entity_mapping: Cross-database ID mappings (no PII)

Security Notes
--------------
Migration operations (ALTER TABLE, ADD CONSTRAINT, CREATE INDEX)
require elevated database privileges. The current implementation
uses the same DATABASE_URL as the application. For production:
1. Set MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL for migration operations
2. Ensure the application DATABASE_URL has minimal privileges
3. MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL should have CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INDEX
   privileges on the schema

Note: The function run_migrations() shares its name with the module
run_migrations.py. If you encounter ImportError, check whether the error
refers to the module or the function by examining the full import chain.

Note on Migration 003 PPI Records:
v9 ROOT FIX (audit F3.7): migration 003 line 243-248 now correctly
SWAPS misordered protein_a_id / protein_b_id pairs via a single
UPDATE statement (SET protein_a_id = protein_b_id, protein_b_id =
protein_a_id WHERE protein_a_id > protein_b_id). The previous
implementation DELETED misordered rows -- that was data loss. The
swap preserves every PPI edge while enforcing the ordering
constraint (protein_a_id < protein_b_id). The docstring above is
retained as a historical note; the code is now correct.

Note on Migration 002 NULL Replacement:
Migration 002 replaces NULL values with empty strings in
gene_disease_associations (gene_symbol, disease_id, source) to support
the UNIQUE constraint with COALESCE. This is a known semantic tradeoff:
NULL ('unknown') becomes '' ('empty'). Downstream code MUST use
COALESCE(gene_symbol, '') for correct queries, not IS NULL checks.

Note on Batch Processing for Large Data:
For datasets exceeding 100K rows, destructive operations in migrations
should use batched DELETE with LIMIT clauses to avoid O(n^2) self-joins
and excessive lock times. Example:
  DELETE FROM table WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table LIMIT 10000)
Repeat until 0 rows affected.

Note on Concurrent Index Creation:
For production databases with >1M rows, consider using
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY (PostgreSQL) to avoid blocking concurrent
writes. The current migration system does not support concurrent
index creation -- this is a known limitation for the Alembic migration.

# K fix (test isolation): Resolve the function/submodule naming collision.
#
# ``database.migrations.run_migrations`` is BOTH a function (defined in
# run_migrations.py) AND a submodule (run_migrations.py itself). When the
# submodule is imported (e.g. by ``from database.migrations.run_migrations
# import _split_sql_statements``), Python automatically sets
# ``database.migrations.__dict__['run_migrations'] = <submodule>``,
# shadowing the function. After that, ``from database.migrations import
# run_migrations`` returns the submodule instead of the function -- and
# ``__getattr__`` never fires (because the attribute IS in ``__dict__``).
#
# We work around this by hooking into the submodule's import: when
# run_migrations.py finishes loading, it calls back into this package and
# overrides ``__dict__['run_migrations']`` with the function. This ensures
# the function is always exposed regardless of import order.
#
# Additionally, we use __getattribute__ override to detect when the
# submodule has shadowed the function and fix it on the fly.
