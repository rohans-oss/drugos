# DrugOS — Autonomous Drug Repurposing Platform

A production-grade SaaS frontend + backend for drug repurposing research, with
real-time integration to authoritative public biomedical databases.

## 🆕 What's new

### v0.5.0 — Login flow + admin role fix
- **Login no longer "refreshes" silently.** Fixed a race condition where the AppShell auth guard redirected to `/login` before the session had a chance to load. The `SessionProvider` now uses a `mounted` flag so `loading` stays `true` until the first `/api/auth/me` fetch resolves.
- **Admin role is back in the Register dropdown.** Full list: Researcher, Data Scientist, Principal Investigator, **Admin**, Business Development, Developer, Viewer.

### v0.4.0 — Role-Based Access Control + Real Profile & Team Data
- **Researchers no longer see admin sections.** The sidebar filters items based on the user's role (`src/lib/rbac.ts`). Direct navigation to a forbidden section shows an "Access denied" page.
- **Profile page uses real data.** No more hardcoded "Dr. Sarah Chen" — the profile pulls from `/api/auth/me` and saves changes via `PATCH /api/auth/me`.
- **Hydration error fixed.** The `SessionProvider` now starts with `loading: false` so the server-rendered HTML matches the first client render.
- **No duplicate role selection.** Register now collects the role and skips the redundant onboarding-role step.
- **Team Members page uses real data.** New `GET /api/team` endpoint returns the actual members of the user's organization.

### v0.3.0 — Frontend↔backend auth wiring
The frontend auth flow is now **fully wired to the backend**. Previously the
"Start Free" and "Sign In" buttons just navigated to the dashboard without
calling any API — now they hit `POST /api/auth/login` and
`POST /api/auth/register`, set the auth cookies, hydrate the session from
`GET /api/auth/me`, and only navigate on success. The `/app` route is now
auth-guarded: if you don't have a valid session you get bounced to `/login`.

See [`UPGRADE_NOTES.md`](./UPGRADE_NOTES.md) for the complete diff.

## ⚠️ Scientific Integrity Notice

This platform handles data that could inform pharmaceutical research decisions.
**We never fabricate scientific data.** Every drug name, clinical trial,
adverse event, and literature article returned by this platform is fetched
live from authoritative public APIs:

| Domain | Source | License |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Drug nomenclature | [RxNorm](https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/) (NIH/NLM) | Public domain |
| Disease vocabulary | [MeSH](https://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) (NIH/NLM) | Public domain |
| Clinical trials | [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2) (NLM) | Public domain |
| Biomedical literature | [PubMed E-utilities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25501/) (NCBI) | Public domain |
| Adverse events | [openFDA](https://open.fda.gov/) (FDA) | Public domain |
| Patent data | [PatentsView](https://patentsview.org/) (USPTO) | Public domain |

The three core ML subsystems — **knowledge graph**, **dataset pipeline**,
and **RL hypothesis ranker** — are owned by the standalone ML services
(Phases 1, 2, and 4 of the build plan) and are intentionally NOT implemented
in this repo. Their API endpoints return `503 service_not_deployed` with an
explicit refusal to fabricate data.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **React 19** + **Tailwind CSS 4** + **shadcn/ui**
- 232 UI screens across 14 categories: AUTH, CORE, DASH, DATA, COLLAB, PUB,
  BILL, ADMIN, LEGAL, DEV, SET, SUPP, INV, MISC
- Client-side routing via `src/components/drugos/app-router.tsx`
- Mock data for screens that don't yet call the backend (in `src/lib/mock-data.ts`)

### Backend
- **Next.js Route Handlers** in `src/app/api/`
- **Prisma ORM** + **SQLite** (production-ready: swap DATABASE_URL for Postgres)
- **bcrypt** (cost factor 12) for password hashing
- **JWT** (HS256, 15-min access tokens) + opaque refresh tokens (30-day, DB-backed)
- Service layer in `src/lib/services/` — pure functions, fully unit-tested

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.0+
- SQLite (file-based, no server needed)

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install   # or npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to set JWT_SECRET to a random 32-byte hex string

# Initialize database
bun x prisma db push
bun x prisma generate

# Start dev server
bun run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | SQLite file URL (`file:./db/custom.db`) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Random hex string for JWT signing (min 32 bytes) |
| `NCBI_API_KEY` | Optional | Increases PubMed rate limit from 3 to 10 req/sec |
| `PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY` | Optional | Required for patent search (free at patentsview.org) |
| `KG_SERVICE_URL` | Optional | When set, knowledge-graph endpoint forwards to it |
| `DATASET_SERVICE_URL` | Optional | When set, dataset endpoint forwards to it |
| `RL_SERVICE_URL` | Optional | When set, RL endpoint forwards to it |

## Testing

The test suite has three layers (110 tests total):

```bash
# Run all tests
bun run test

# Run individual layers
bun run test:unit          # 67 backend unit tests (Jest)
bun run test:integration   # 21 integration tests (Node script)
bun run test:e2e           # 22 Playwright E2E tests
```

### Test Coverage

**Backend unit tests (67)** verify:
- Real PubMed searches return peer-reviewed articles with valid PMIDs
- Real ClinicalTrials.gov trials have valid NCT IDs (NCT + 8 digits)
- Real openFDA data ALWAYS carries the safety disclaimer
- Real RxNorm returns canonical RxCUI for known drugs (e.g., aspirin = 1191)
- bcrypt password hashing with cost factor 12
- JWT signing/verification with HS256; rejection of tampered tokens
- Password policy enforces OWASP-recommended complexity
- Billing state machine: plan transitions, invoice generation
- API keys: only SHA-256 hashes stored, raw key never persisted
- Evidence packages: real literature + trials + safety, NO model predictions
- ML stubs: REFUSE to fabricate data when underlying service not deployed

**Integration tests (21)** verify the full HTTP stack:
- Auth: register → login → me → logout flow
- Auth: duplicate email rejected with 409
- Auth: weak password rejected with 400
- Auth: wrong password rejected with 401
- Protected endpoints reject unauthenticated requests
- Admin endpoints reject non-admin users
- ML stubs return 503 with refusal-to-fabricate message
- All live biomedical APIs return real, validated data

**E2E tests (22)** use Playwright to verify:
- Landing page renders without console errors
- All public pages load successfully
- All API endpoints respond correctly via the browser context
- Real PubMed/CT.gov/openFDA/RxNorm data flows through to the frontend

## Scientific Accuracy Guarantees

1. **No fabricated predictions.** The RL hypothesis ranker (Phase 4) is owned
   by the standalone ML service. This backend NEVER returns a "repurposing
   score" or "repurposing recommendation" — it returns literature, trials,
   and safety data that a human researcher can interpret.

2. **No fabricated graph data.** The knowledge graph (Phase 2) is owned by
   the standalone Neo4j service. This backend NEVER returns drug-protein,
   protein-pathway, or pathway-disease relationships from mock data.

3. **No fabricated dataset statistics.** The Airflow data pipeline (Phase 1)
   is owned by the standalone ETL service. This backend NEVER returns
   "10,000 drugs ingested" or similar claims without verification.

4. **Adverse event data is explicitly caveated.** Every openFDA response
   carries the disclaimer: "Reports are spontaneous and do not prove
   causation. A report listing a drug and an event does not mean the drug
   caused the event."

5. **All biomedical identifiers are validated.** PMIDs match `/^\d+$/`,
   NCT IDs match `/^NCT\d{8}$/`, RxCUIs match `/^\d+$/`. Test failures
   on these patterns indicate a bug, not a test issue.

## Production Deployment

This codebase is production-ready with the following adjustments:

1. **Swap SQLite for PostgreSQL** — change `DATABASE_URL` and the Prisma
   `datasource` provider.
2. **Set a strong JWT_SECRET** — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
3. **Configure NCBI_API_KEY** — register at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/settings/
4. **Configure PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY** — request at https://patentsview.org/apis/keyrequest
5. **Add Stripe** — replace the mock billing service with Stripe webhooks.
6. **Deploy the ML services** — set `KG_SERVICE_URL`, `DATASET_SERVICE_URL`,
   `RL_SERVICE_URL` to enable the Phase 1/2/4 endpoints.
